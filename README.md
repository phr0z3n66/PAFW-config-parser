# PAFW-config-parser
simple python script to export information from a Palo Alto Firewall configuration file (xml)


this needs some updates that i will do in the next month or so

one of which is to catch some of the parsing issues i've discovered and the 2nd is to drop everything into an excel file instead of seperate csv's


Usage
 python paloalto-config-parser.py [-h] -f <configuration-file> -o <output-file>
